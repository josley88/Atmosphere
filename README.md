Howdy! We are Team Atmosphere: three guys creating a project to allow our fellow students and music lovers to “get into the mood” and listen to music that reflects their current environment.

We started this project in Spring 2022 in our CSCE 315 class but hope to continue developing Atmosphere and provide new features. This project has overall been very fun for us as we experienced a dev team environment for a large-scale project.

We hope you like Atmosphere as much as we do!
